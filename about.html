      <h1>Who am I?</h1>
      <p>
        I'm a front-end developer dangerously close to being full stack. Over my years of development I've written code in over a dozen languages, with 6 of those languages practiced in the past year. From CSS/HTML/JS to Swift, GAS and BASH I've been able to change my development stack to meet my project needs. But what am I most practiced in? CSS/HTML/JS of course! Where I feel my real value comes from is my architecting and system design theory which I've proven time and again is efficient, productive and is insightful as possible.

      <h1>Some recent praise!</h1>
      <p>
        2015-2017 has been a very exciting time for me! Working at an amazing place like Blue Acorn allowed me the opportunity to work in a dynamic growing environment. One brilliant trend they set within the company was internal recognition of their employees. At first this praise was informal until a technical solution was put in place for the task. Welcome Teamphoria.
      </p>
      <p>
        During my time with Blue Acorn I was the most publicly praised Front-End developer on staff. Every month I strived to push production and quality farther and every month people recognized my worth to a development team. Whether it was interactions with clients, account managers, project managers or other developers I made sure I did my best to make sure everyone could succeed.
      </p>
      <h2>Just how diverse am I?</h2>
      <p>
        I glad you asked! In the past year alone I worked on a company's first automated continuous integration QA system using Docker containers, led a company's first augmented staff project that spanned 3 continents, created the first command line Magento2 automated installer using BASH, was recognized by ECG (the Magento consultant group) for UI innovation suggestions and bug reporting, and even won our yearly comany pool tournament.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'd be remiss to not acknowledge that this does sound braggadocious but it could not be farther from it. There's only 2 things that drive me to work on a project day in day out. One, what is the right answer. Two, can I work hard to excel and make others around me successful in the process.
      </p>
